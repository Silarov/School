#Learning Objectives 

describe the key events and outcomes of the 1905 Russian Revolution.  
Due to failed attempts by the Russian imperial government to satisfy the people and their inability to do so lead to a rise in anti-government media and strikes starting in 1904. In an attempt to unite the country behind a victory, the tsar ordered war against Japan, failing and suffering multiple humiliating defeats. 

Bloody Sunday
On Sunday 22.01.1905 200’000 protestors came to the tsar’s residence to give the tsar a petition. While the tsar wasn’t there, soldiers unexpectedly opened fire and the ordinary people lost trust in the tsar
In the aftermath of the Bloody Sunday, the tsar started losing some control – his uncle was assassinated, sailors aboard a battleship revolted and a General Strike paralyzed the economy. Soviets began to be formed in the countryside.

Response of the tsar
The tsar responded with the October Manifesto, where he offered an elected parliament the “Duma”, the right to free speech and to form political parties. He announced further concessions and financial help in November. 
Some people were suspicious, righteously so – the tsar signed peace with Japan, and crushed the revolts with his troops. By March 1906, all leaders were either dead, exiled or living abroad and the revolution was crushed. The Tsar underlined his victory with the Fundamental Laws, establishing a nearly powerless duma.


explain the causes and consequences of the Russian Revolution of 1917.  

March Revolution (February revolution in Julian calendar)
At the beginning of 1917, the tsar’s regime was doomed – they were losing in the war and the economy was in shambles. In January, strikes broke out and spread to the entire empire – sometimes even by parts of the army. 
The duma began setting up a provisional committee to take over government – the tsar ordered them to disband, they refused. After that, the tsar ordered the army to crush the strikes – they refused. The duma leaders began taking over government, while the Petrograd soviet was formed again – leading to the abdication of the tsar and unclear power balance. 
The provisional government however was unstable – it contained many different people of differing views – and it hat competition with the Petrograd soviet. During 1917, the influence of the government steadily collapsed due to the ongoing war and failure of reforms in the countryside. 

November revolution (October revolution in Julian calendar) 
The Bolsheviks promised to do the things the other government wouldn’t do and by November, the red guards led by Trotsky took control of post offices, bridges and state bank, as well as the winter palace, toppling the provisional government. 

Consequences
Lenin immediately set up the council of people’s commissars, which issued peace with Germany and distributed land to the peasants. He organized a constitutional assembly, failing to gain a majority, and subsequently used the congress of Soviets to pass laws. He established a communist dictatorship. Anti-Bolshevik people formed the “Whites”, leading to a Russian civil war, that would lead to the win for the Bolsheviks and the death of the tsar. 


analyze the impact of the Russian Civil War on the emergence of the Soviet Union.  

The Red Army was no match for the armies on the western front, but compared to the undisciplined and unorganized Whites, they were united and disciplined. They also maintained the control over western Russia – feeding the people, taking over factories for supply and the red terror. They also had territorial advantages, because they controlled a contiguous territory, while the whites were spread out and supported by foreign powers.
The policies enacted by Lenin during this time caused terrible hardships for many but let them win the war. Subsequently, new changes were implemented, improving the conditions and introducing some amount of capitalism back. Due to the win in the civil war, Lenin was able to form the USSR out of the shambles of the Russian Empire.


identify major policies and changes implemented by Lenin during his leadership.  

Due to the civil war, Lenin introduced a new economic policy “War Communism”, aiming to put communist theories into practice and supply the towns and red army:
- Factories taken over by the government
- Planned and organized production by government
- Strict discipline
- Food rations
- Free enterprise is illegal
  
Though letting them win, those policies caused terrible hardship and many dying.
In 1921, he introduced another round of changes “New Economic Policy”, which introduced small steps backwards towards capitalism – while the big and important industries remained in state hands, small factories were handed back into private hands and private trading of small goods was allowed in the towns.
Lenin was a remarkable man and led Russia through revolution and civil war and supervised the creation of a new constitution, creating the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic out of the Russian Empire. 


evaluate the significance of Stalin’s rule on the USSR, including collectivization and the Great Purge.  

Stalin was a clever politician and planned his ascent carefully – he made efforts to associate himself with Lenin and through his many jobs within the party set many of his own people in important positions.
Once in power, he ended the new economic policy of Lenin and modernized the union through a series of Five-Year plans, setting ambitious targets for production. This led to rapid industrialization in remote parts of the country and by 1937, it was basically a modern state. The USSR had more doctors per capita than Britain, a very low unemployment-rate and many women working – but the workers were bombarded with propaganda and the life was very harsh (discipline in industry, infrastructure built by prisoners)

Collectivization

To achieve modernization and to feed all people, Stalin introduced Collectivization; Large farms were formed out of small ones, animals and tools were pooled together, tractors were made available, 90% of things produced would be sold to the state. Since opposing farmers refused to change their ways and sometimes destroyed their crop or their harvest was taken away, millions starved in Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

Purge

To maintain the changes and to crush opponents, Stalin used the secret police and put many of his opponents on trial or even outright purged the party of opposition after the murder of the leader of the Leningrad Soviet Party. Thousands were trialed for “anti-Soviet activities” and sent to labor camps or executed. It ranged from the supreme commander of the red army down to normal workers. Arrests happened unexpectedly and included torture. Abt. 18 million people were sent to gulags, while about 10 million were killed and made the USSR significantly weaker when Germany invaded.

Cult

He introduced a new constitution in 1936, establishing supposed free speech and free elections, which were, rather obviously, controlled by the party. However, Stalin was popular among peasants, and he was named “Dictator of the people” - the belief in him was built up by the party and himself.


Describe the political and economic challenges faced by the Weimar Republic after WWI. 

Political
- Quick change from monarchy to democracy leading to opposition
- Many advisors of the kaiser were still in powerful positions
- Stab-in the back-legend 
- Threat of a communist revolution and the right
  
Economic
- Germany was basically bankrupt
o   Industrial production was only 2/3 of prewar state
o   National income was 1/3 of prewar state
o   Abt. 600’000 widows and 2 million fatherless children after war (war pensions)
- War reparations of the peace treaties
- Occupation of the Ruhr by France
- Hyperinflation
- Great depression and wall street crash (ripple effect)

  
explain the key provisions of the Treaty of Versailles and know their impact on Germany.  

Germany lost:
- 10 percent of the land (Alsace and parts of east Prussia
- All colonies
- 12.5% of population
- 16% of its coal and 48% of iron industry
  
Furthermore;
- Army reduced to 100’000, no Airforce allowed and navy restricted
- War reparations needed to be paid
- Germany was the sole reasons for the war
  
Germans were against the treaty – the kaiser and with him the reason of the war was gone, and they should be punished? Opponents of the president Eber blamed him. The stab in the back-myth didn’t help as well (Germany supposedly was undefeated in the field and only the politicians “stabbed” the army in the back).

It destabilized Germany politically, leading to many changes of government and economic chaos ensued. After reparations could not be paid in 1922, France and Belgium marched into Germany and occupied the Ruhr and took what was owed to them in form of materials and goods. The government ordered strike – the complete halt in the economic heartland led to the collapse of the German currency.  So, the government began to just print more money with basically worthless currency. With so much money around, prices and wages rocketed, leading to many sufferings.
With Gustav Stresemann coming to power in Germany, conditions improved – the economy stabilized, France and other countries became more sympathetic. Even politics stabilized somewhat. 


analyze the rise of Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany.  

The NSDAP (do I really have to explain the acronym?) was a far-right extremist party formed in 1919 – due to Hitlers great talent, he rose quickly within its ranks and was in charge of propaganda. It announced its 25-point program. He ousted the previous leader “Anton Drexler” and stirred nationalist passions in his audiences. He gave them scapegoats for Germany’s problems. By 1923, they were still a minority, but well known.
By 1923, Hitler deemed the moment ready for toppling the government and during the government’s preoccupation with the invasion of the Ruhr, he announced he was taking over the Bavarian Government and took over official buildings. It failed, however, due to a quick response by the government and lack of support by the people. He got a lot of publicity out of the following trial though. He impressed the judges and was only convicted to 5 years in jail instead of a life sentence. 
While in prison, he wrote “Mein Kampf”, which detailed his ideas about Germany’s future and realized, that the nazis would have to take over government through the system to destroy it. Through youth organizations, both the NSDAP and KPD (communist party of Germany) gained popularity and won some seats in the parliament. He appealed to peasants and conservatives. 
The stock market crash at Wall Street in 1929 caused the collapse of economy in Germany, due to the American debt Germany had. 
Their party program and propaganda were attractive to those most affected – leading to a rise in seats and destabilization of the politics. They also organized soup kitchens and provided shelter and looked rather organized in those dire times. 
The government collapsed multiple times, leading to rapidly changing majorities and elections of the parliament – the president began to use his emergency powers often.
After the vote share of the nazis decreased in 1932, the government changed three times within the year, the democratic system failed – Hindenburg was practically overthrowing the principles of the system and reluctantly offered Hitler the post as chancellor after denying it him 3 times.  He thought he could control Hitler due to some behind the scenes deals.


know why the Weimar Republic failed.  

Due to a combination of factors mentioned above:
* Nazi strengths
o Propaganda
o Criticism
o Policies
* Weakness of opponents
o Failure to deal with Depression
o Attitudes of Germans to the democratic parties
o Failure to co-operate with one another 
* Other factors
o Weaknesses of the Weimar republic
o Scheming of Hindenburg and von Papen
o The impact of depression
o Stab in the back myth
o Treaty of Versailles
o Memories of the problems of 1923

discuss the major policies and actions of the Nazi regime (how the Nazis controlled Germany & what it was like to live in Nazi Germany). 


Reichstag fire

Hitler began taking over Germany following the Reichstagsfire – he used it to get emergency powers to deal with the situation and arrested communists, broke up meetings and frightened voters. It’s not known who was to blame for the fire.
In the following election, he gained a majority and used intimidation tactics to pass the Enabling Act “Ermächtigungsgesetz”, enabling him to pass laws without the Reichstag.

Night of the Long Knives
Hitler had to choose between the Army and his SA – at the end of June, he purged leading figures of the SA and let them be executed. It effectively purged all opposition in the SA (paramilitary of the NSDAP) of his opponents.

Control
No opposition was to be allowed, no rival parties, no debate.
- SS -> fanatics loyal to Hitler and destroying the SA, responsible for destroying opposition to Nazism
- Gestapo -> secret state police
- Police and courts -> top jobs were given to party functionaries
- Concentration camps -> forced to do labor, containing Jews, socialists, communists and many more in opposition.
  
Opposition
There was relatively little open opposition while in power; Due to the terror they inflicted, the people were too afraid to voice criticism outside their own homes. Also due to the recovery of Germany after the great depression and the want to not loose their jobs and of course, propaganda. 

Media
The Nazis were in strict control of the media – no books could be published without Goebbels permission, he organized book burnings, artists were restricted, as well as the newspapers and cinema. Everything was made to show the greatness of Hitler and the party. Goebbels enforced this through the SS and the Gestapo

Youth Organization
The schools and youth were completely reorganized to fit the nazis narrative – enforcing the greatness and supremeness of Germans and that loyalty to the Führer was good. 
Members of the Youth organizations were indoctrinated with propaganda, but also lured in with exciting parades and sports.  
Of course, not all people were in support of the Nazi, but there were no legal alternatives, and membership of the Hitler youth was eventually even made compulsory. Some organizations and groups formed nonetheless like the ‘Edelweiss Pirates’ or the ‘Swing’ movement

Women
The role of women was very traditional – they should be wives and mothers first and foremost. They were kept out of jobs, and they were encouraged to have as many children as possible. 

Recovery
Germany benefited at least in some parts from the nazis rule – the economy recovered, and the nation was rearmed – decreasing the unemployment and increasing prosperity. He promised and delivered lower unemployment. 


know about the Holocaust and are able to identify the key events, including the implementation of anti-Jewish laws, and the establishment of concentration camps.  

Minorities
The nazis believed in the superiority of the Aryan race – they persecuted members of other races and minorities like gypsies, homosexuals and disabled people. I.e. all people are against their ideas. 
He hated Jews in particular – they had been discriminated against for hundreds of years and in his view ran many of the most successful businesses. He began banning them from civil service and other public services and mobilized full powers of the state against them. 
In 1938, he implemented the Nuremberg laws, taking away German citizenship of the Jews and forbidding them to marry Germans. They were often refused jobs and people refused to serve them. 

Reichskristallnacht
In November 1938 a young Jew killed a German diplomat in Paris. The Nazis used this as an excuse to launch a violent revenge on Jews. Stores and flats of Jews were destroyed, synagogues burned and taken to concentration camps. It was portrayed later as a spontaneous reaction, was however incited by SS tropers. 

Ghettos
The persecution developed in intensity after the outbreak of war in 1939. After defeating Poland in 1939, the Nazis set about 'Germanizing' western Poland.  Almost one in five Poles died in the fighting and as a result of racial policies of 1939-45. Polish Jews were rounded up and transported to the major cities. Here they were herded into sealed areas, called ghettos. The able-bodied Jews were used for slave labor but the young, the old and the sick were left to die.

Mass murder
In 1941 Germany invaded the USSR. The invasion was successful at first. However, within weeks the Nazis found themselves in control of 3 million Russian Jews. German forces had orders to round up and shoot Communist Party activists and their Jewish supporters. In Germany, all Jews were ordered to wear the star of David on their clothing to mark them out.
In January 1942, senior Nazis to discuss what they called the 'Final Solution' to the 'Jewish Question’. Himmler, head of the SS and Gestapo, was put in charge of the systematic killing of all Jews within German control. Slave labor and death camps were built at Auschwitz, Treblinka, Chelmo and other places. The old, the sick and young children were killed immediately. The able-bodied were first used as slave labor. Some were used for appalling medical experiments. Six million Jews, 500,000 European gypsies and countless political prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals and Russian and Polish prisoners of war were sent to these camps to be worked to death, gassed or shot.

Final Solution
It is debated whether the final solution was planned – the responsibility lies on Hitler, but not solely – people were needed to cooperate:
- Civil service -> collected and stored information of Jews
- Police forces -> many were taken by them instead of SS or Gestapo
- SS -> devised transport system and looted possessions
- Wehrmacht -> leaders were fully aware
- Industry -> some companies had their own camps
- German people -> widespread antisemitism, many closed their eyes to the full reality
  
Resistance
There was resistance however – jews lived undercover, rose up (like in 1943 in the Warsaw ghetto), many also helped Jews by hiding them and smuggling them to safety. Those successful kept an extremely low profile – some are known today, like Oskar Schindler, some are still unknown.


can analyze examples of propaganda and understand its role in spreading anti-Semitic ideologies.

It was vital to spread misinformation and to win elections.  


explain the causes and contributing factors to the Wall Street Crash of 1929.  

Before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the American economy was booming; This was due to the industrial strength of resources and production, the boost provided by the sale of goods to the war parties of WW1 and due to the control of the state by the republican party with its policies:
- Laissez-faire -> “Hands of economy” where the state does not intervene
- Tariffs -> expensive to import goods, protecting the domestic producers
- Low taxation
- Trusts -> huge super-corporations dominating industry
Wall Street is a stock market in New York where you can invest in corporations – due to the boom in America it seemed that you could get rich easy and quick by just buying shares – leading to many ordinary people buying them – in 1928, interest was at a high level, and many were speculating at the market (overspeculation).
Due to a downturn in the construction industry and other industries showing strains after years of boom. Those able to buy goods already bought them and things lay in the stores – usually it would be exported, but due to tariffs by both Europe and the US, that was expensive. By 1929 the weaknesses were showing – sales were slowing down, and output showed a fall for the first time in four years. Speculators began to loose trust and sold their shares. 
Many investors had borrowed money to buy their shares and could not afford to be stuck with shares lower than the value of their loan. People began selling their shares and panic set in. On Tuesday 29.11.1929 (black Tuesday) it became clear to speculators that the banks were not going to intervene to support the price of shares and so Wall Street had its busiest and its worst day in history as speculators desperately tried to dump 13 million shares at a fraction of the price, they had paid for them.


Describe the immediate and long-term economic consequences of the crash, including the Great Depression (especially in the USA & Weimar Republic).  

Short Term
- Large speculators were ruined (mostly the rich that invested most)
- Downturn in spending due to the rich buying less. 
- People could not pay back their loans to banks and insurance, so they went bankrupt, causing banks to also go bankrupt
- President Hoover cutting taxes to boost spending again (lightly worked until 1931)
- Confidence destroyed
- Banking crisis (4300 banks in 3 years), causing people to loose confidence and withdraw their money, leading to bank runs and banks failing
- 1931 banks had problems in Europe, causing more problems in the US
- Triggering the collapse of the German economy
- People saved all their money, leading to a recession/depression, the worst the world had seen.
  
Long term
- Confidence destroyed
- Banking crisis
- Rise of unemployment
- Recession 
- Decrease in wages
- Decrease in trade
- Rise of the nazis
- Establishment of regulation of the market
- New Deal

  
identify and explain the main elements of the New Deal.  

In 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt promised the “New Deal” to use the full power of the federal government to get the US out of depression; His priorities were:
- Getting Americans back to work
- Protecting their savings and property
- Providing relief for sick, old and unemployed
- Getting American industry and agriculture back on their field
  
In his first 100 days of the presidency, he produced an enormous range of sweeping measures:
- Tackling the banking crisis -> all banks were closed and only reopened when the government had checked them, supported by government money if necessary -> Emergency Banking Act and Securities Exchange Commission to prevent reckless speculation that lead to the crash
- Federal Emergency Relief Administration set up for meeting the needs of the poor – soup kitchens, blankets, employment and nurseries.
- Civil Conservation Corps – environmental projects in national parks aimed at unemployed young men
- Agricultural Adjustment Administration – solving the long-term problems of the farmers, helped reduce farm production to battle deflation and modernization.
- Public Works Administration – building schools, roads, dams, bridges and airports
- National Recovery Administration – improving working conditions and outlawing child labor, stimulate the economy. 
- Tennessee Valley Authority – improving state of Tennessee valley agriculture through a series of dams evaluate the effectiveness of Roosevelt’s leadership and the New Deal in addressing the Great Depression.
  
Confidence in the government was restored and Roosevelt was very popular; Despite his achievements, he faced criticism. The US recovered slower than Europe – he conferred with groups of senators and the leader of congress to introduce new laws known as the second new deal:
- Wagner Act: all employers must allow trade unions
- Social Security Act: state pensions for elderly and widows, sick and disabled as well as unemployment insurance.
- Works Progress Administration -> bundling all organizations with the aim of creating jobs.
- Resettlement Administration -> helping small farmers not helped by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, moving families to better land and housing – later replaced by the Farm Security Administration, giving loans to small farmers to help buy land and built camps to provide decent living conditions and work for migrants.

  
assess the impact of Roosevelt’s presidency on American society and politics. 

Roosevelt was a popular president, winning 4 elections as US-President, each time basically a landslide – he is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in US history and a very influential person of the 20th century. He brought the country not only through the worst depression the country had seen, but also influencing Europe and its order past the second world war. He was committed to providing relief for the working class and unemployed and introduced programs that even today still exists, like the social security and expansion of the welfare-state. 
He positioned the US as a superpower as well as a boom in postwar Europe.
